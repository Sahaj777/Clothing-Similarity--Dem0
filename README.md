# Clothing-Similarity
1. I have tried web scraping using NLP and TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe for  Clothing Similarity
And I didnâ€™t get solution. Let me check above SS. and I got solution another option used selenium  library with NLP and APIs. let me check below SS.

2. I create rest api using flask with product name and brand name. And I tested this api on postman. I gave input product name and brand name and get output top-N most similar items.

3. And last deploy with docker file. I have issue for billing with credit card. So please i request you if you have already billed on GCP. you can share credentials detail . i can  do this work.
4. No worry, I have worked with deploy with docker image. It is worked for cloud run with docker container image.
